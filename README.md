## Hi there 👋
# Muhammad Shaharyar

I’m an Associate Software Engineer focused on building clean, scalable full-stack systems. I’m passionate about crafting reliable, maintainable code and solving real-world problems using modern web technologies and AI-powered solutions.

I primarily work with **MERN stack** Python, and PostgreSQL, but I also explore other tools like Nest.js, FastAPI, Web3.js, and AI/ML frameworks to expand my skills.

### What I Do
- Build and maintain full-stack web applications and AI-powered systems  
- Focus on clean, efficient, and scalable code  
- Integrate modern tools and frameworks to solve real-world problems  
- Create reusable components, APIs, and backend modules  

### Skills & Tech
I specialise in **MERN stack** development, AI/ML integration, and database management. I use **React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Nest.js, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**, and AI tools like **HuggingFace Transformers** and **FAISS**. I also rely on **Git, Docker, Postman**, and deployment platforms to optimise workflows.
